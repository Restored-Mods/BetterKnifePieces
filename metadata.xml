	<description>Have you ever got tired of going through mirror dimension and mineshaft just to collect knife pieces to progress to the Corpse?
This mod fixes that problem by making them appear in the rooms with mirror and minecart after you collected them ones and left correcponding dimentions.
Does this those alt paths are useless now? No. Instead of knife pieces they will contain random item from their item pools, giving you an option to go after extra item or just continue your path to the Corpse.
